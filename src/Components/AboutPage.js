                If you were to guess, what percentage of it goes to a landfill or is recycled.

                Does this seem like an incalculable amount?

                How about how much trash you produce in a week? A day? An hour?

            Much of what is sold today is meant to be mindless tossed out. We hope that by having you challenge yourself and keep track of your trash for a day, or a week, (or a year!) you are empowered to buy and consume in a more intentional and low impact manner. â™¥
